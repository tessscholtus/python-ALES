# Generic prompt additions
prompt_additions:
  material:
    - "Check BOM/title block under 'Material'/'Materiaal'."
    - "Extract the full material specification (grade/number + thickness if present)."
    - "Include pre-applied coating only when it is part of the material spec (e.g., +Z275)."
    - "Do not output generic types like Sheet/Plaat/Tube as material."
  
  surface_treatment:
    - "Use Finish/Nabehandeling field in title block/BOM."
    - "If empty/'-'/'None' → output 'None'."
    - "Coating embedded in material spec (e.g., DX51D+Z275) is not a surface treatment."
    - "Only output additional treatments listed separately from material."
  
  holes:
    - "**CRITICAL - ONLY TEXT CALLOUTS**: Extract holes ONLY from text annotations/callouts on the drawing"
    - "**DO NOT COUNT** holes that are only visible in views without text callouts"
    - "**QUANTITY RULES**:"
    - "  - If you see 'M8' (no number) → that's 1x M8"
    - "  - If you see '2x M8' → that's 2x M8"
    - "  - If you see '4x Ø10' → that's 4x Ø10"
    - "**IGNORE** holes visible in drawings that have NO text callout/dimension"
    - "Format: Ø for normal holes, M for tapped/threaded holes"
    - "Extract holes with special properties: tolerances, ISO fits, threaded holes"
  
  tolerated_lengths:
    - "Only extract dimensions with explicit tolerances (±, +/-, ISO fits)"
    - "Ignore general dimensions without tolerances"

# Material patterns for prompt
material_patterns:
  - "Check BOM table or title block under 'Material' or 'Materiaal'"
  - "Extract COMPLETE specification including material number and grade"
  - "Include pre-applied coatings if part of material (e.g., DX51D+Z275)"
  - "Examples: '1.0226 (DX51D+Z275/N-A-C)', '304', '316L', 'S235', 'AISI 304 DIN 1.4301'"
  - "Do NOT extract generic types like 'Sheet', 'Plate', 'Tube'"
